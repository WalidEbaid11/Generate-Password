# Generate-Password
 Generate Password is a user-friendly shell script for creating strong and random passwords, along with username generation. Users input their username ("my name"), select a password length (e.g., "8"), and receive a confirmation with the generated password ("eYGMslcG"). The output is saved to "output.txt," enhancing account security.
